Options for the project:

● Proposal presented today
○ Thefollowing proposalmust be consideredjust asa base.
○ Allthe mainfunctionalitieslistedmust be implemented(minimal
requirementsto havethe project accepted).

Introduction
Six deadlines over the year(the onesbeloware tentative , alwaysrelyon Virtuale ):

Ifyouchooseto follow today'sspecificationyoucannotpresentyourproject after February.

Rules
● Projects describedin the following must be developedby a single studentor a group
of twostudents (for 2 studentsthereisan integrationto the maintrack).
● Project implementationmust be originaland 100% studentwork (no code share or
reuse).
● Submitthe project ontoVirtuale (https://virtuale.unibo.it) includingthe code and a
technical report
● The examconsistof a project discussionand an oralexamination
● The discussionisper group
● The oralisper student
● ALWAYS SUBSCRIBE THROUGH ALMAESAMI
Rules
Read and follow the instructionsaboutprojects submissionpolicies (deadlines,
validity, etc) on the coursewebsite:
https://virtuale.unibo.it/course/view.php?id=
● Thereisa PDF with the exactinstructionsto follow.
THE PDF CONTAINS THE RULES, SLIDES ARE INDICATIVE
● The sametrack for Android, iOS and Hybridprojects
○ We know iOS hadlesslectures-> becauseyoucan always do itin Android.
○ iOS isconsideredan alternative basedon your own choice.
○ Youcan alsouse a hybridframework, BUT youcannotdevelopa Web
Application.
The Exam
● Deliverthe CODE and a pdf REPORT.
○ Thereare constraintson howto name them
○ Eachgroup just uploads once
● In the project discussionyouwillpresentyourproject using SLIDES
○ Bringthemwith you, do notupload them
○ 10 - 15 slides isthe best bet, considertaking10 minutes for your
explanation
The Exam
The Report shouldbe namedSURNAME1_SURNAME2.pdf and contain:
The name, surname, email, and matriculationnumberof eachcomponent of the
group.
Overviewof the applicationwith screenshots.
Implementationdetailson howyouchoseto implementthe functionalities.
A good report isprobablybetween10 and 15 pages. Lessthan5 pages are
probablybad, and more than 15 isprobablytoomany. The qualityof the
report WILL be part of the evaluation. A good report alsocontains
about70% of implementationdetailsand choicesand onlytheremaining30% of
screenshots, overview...
The Exam
Ifthe code istoobulkyfor Virtuale evenafter removingthe build generatedfiles:
● Upload the code to Drive/OneDrive
● Make a HASH
● Upload the zip with the report, the hashand the download link on virtuale
The Exam
● On the examday therewillalsobe an oralexaminationconcerninga "theory part".
In case of a group, the project discussionwilltake place with the wholegroup and
the theory part willtake place individually.
● The oralexaminationisaboutallwehaveseenduringthe courselectures.
Alternatives
Propose yourown
● propose yourownproject by writing an e-mail to
lorenzo.gigli@unibo.it
● It needs to include a list of requirements thatyouaimto satisfy
● DO NOT BRING PROJECTS FROM THE LAST YEARS
● Ideallyitmust be somethingthatcannotbe donewith Webapps
● A backendwillnotbe evaluated
Seminar
Do a seminar INSTEAD of implementinga project
An analternative to the project, a student may choose to propose
a seminar. In this case, the student must propose a topic, obviously
coherent with the course, about a technology that however is not
in the contents of the course. Examples are:
React Native
Ionic -React
Xamarin
Kotlin Multiplatform
Seminar
Do a seminar INSTEAD of implementinga project
These are only examples and we welcome proposals. The seminar
must be in the form of a small lecture (30-40 minutes) held by the
student in front of the class, possibly during the last lectures in May.
The Lecture must include slides and a little bit of live coding. If the
student chooses this path, then only the oral examination will be
required.
Please send all your seminar proposals to me!
Project: Travel Companion
Mobile application that assists users in planning,

tracking, and documenting their travel experiences.

Create trip plans
Log journeys using GPS
Attach photos and notes to journeys
Visualize travel history through maps and statistics
Project: Travel Companion
Record the Activities:

UI for creating trip plans (e.g., destination, travel dates)
Manually start/stop journey logging during travel
Attach photos and notes to specific moments and locations
Store all trip-related data in a local database
Project: Travel Companion
The application must support at least three mandatory trip types:

Local trip (e.g., within the city)
Day trip (e.g., a short out-of-town excursion)
Multi-day trip (e.g., a vacation)
Users must be able to view their past trips and logged journeys in a list or on a map,
with at least one filtering option (e.g., by date, destination, or trip type).

Project: Travel Companion
Display charts:

The application must include a section displaying at least two different visualizations of
the user’s travel data:

Map view: Displays recorded travel routes or generates a heat map of visited
locations over a selected period (e.g., the past month)
Bar Chart or Timeline: Shows the number of trips taken or the total distance traveled
per month
Project: Travel Companion
Perform Background Jobs:

At least one periodic notification :
o Alerts about nearby points of interest (e.g., landmarks or attractions) based on
the user’s current GPS location
o Reminders to log a journey if the user has not recorded a trip recently
One additional background operation:
o Automatic Journey Tracking
o Geofencing
Project: Travel Companion for 2 students
Personalized Progress Prediction Module:

Data Analysis: Identifies patterns in past trips (e.g., frequency, distances, visited
locations)
Forecast Generation: Predicts key metrics (e.g., projected trips, estimated distances)
with interactive visualizations
Personalized Goal Recommendations: Suggests new trips or increased travel
frequency based on trends
Local Execution: All processing occurs on-device, ensuring privacy and independence
Project: Trust App
Mobile application for trusted data collection.

Interact with blockchain smart contracts to request
trusted IoT data
Store data locally and visualize it via an intuitive UI
Integrate MetaMask for wallet management
Execute transactions on Ethereum Sepolia
